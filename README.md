# Text-Extractor-from-Image

1. Import the following libraries:
   - NumPy
   - Matplotlib
   - EasyOCR
   - PyTesseract
   - OpenCV

2. Download Tesseract:
   - For Windows use the link - `https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/releases/download/v5.4.0.20240606/tesseract-ocr-w64-setup-5.4.0.20240606.exe`
   - For MacOS run the commands - `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"` and `brew install tesseract` in the terminal

3. Once the installation of Tesseract is done, open the folder > copy the path of the `tesseract.exe` file > paste it in the code.

4. Download the image > copy the path of the image > paste it in the code

5. The code will convert the image to grayscale and extract the text from that. After this is done, the grayscale image and the text extracted will be shown in the output section.

6. Here is how the output will look like:
